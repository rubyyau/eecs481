Description of the game: 
This is a really simple classic game called Sliding Puzzle. This puzzle is 3x3 and it’s made up of the number tile 1 through 8. The goal of the game is to “slide” the block so that the numbers will appear in order (1,2,3 on the first row and leaving the bottom right corner as blank). You can only slide a tile that has an empty white space next to it. In this game, you need to click on the block that you want to slide and it will slide to the available empty spot. If you want to start over at any time, you click ‘Reset’ to reset the board to the original view.
